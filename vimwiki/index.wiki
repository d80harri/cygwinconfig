The diary helps you make daily notes. You can easily add information into
Vimwiki that should be sorted out later. Just hit <Leader>w<Leader>w to create
a new note for today with a name based on the current date.

To generate the diary section with all available links one can use
|:VimwikiDiaryGenerateLinks| or <Leader>w<Leader>i .
